Dropship

Dropship is not for deploying apps. Dropship is for deploying yourself.

Install your dev environment on OS X with one command, uninstall and leave no trace with one more.

Does one thing:
1. Bootstrap a package manager
$ dropship

Coming soon:
2. Bootstrap a package manager and automate installation of a list of apps
$ dropship < myprograms.txt
3. Revert all changes made by Dropship and its package manager
$ dropship -evac
3. Support for more UNIX-like systems

WARNINGS:
Dropship appends ~/dev/homebrew/bin to the front of your PATH.
