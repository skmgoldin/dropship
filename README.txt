Dropship
0.0.1

Dropship is not for deploying apps. Dropship is for deploying yourself.

Install your dev environment on OS X with one command.

Does one thing: bootstraps a package manager into the PATH.
$ dropship

Coming soon:
- Support for more systems (Raspbian, Amazon Linux...).
- Bootstrap a package manager and automate installation of a list of apps.
$ dropship < myprograms.txt
- Drop in to a custom location.
$ dropship ~/dev
- Revert all changes made by Dropship and its package manager.
$ dropship -evac
